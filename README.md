# Income, Rent, and Tax Calculator

In NZ certain homes are given an income related rent system.

This means the tenants pay a percentage of their income to their rent each week.

This allows people to more easily afford making rental payments.

This is a Xamarin Android app that calculates the income related amount.

However, the app is more than that.

It also uses the tax tables provided by IRD to accurately provide tax information too.

You can use the app to calculate KiwiSaver, and Student Loan Deductions, as well as budget for Rent (whether you're on Income Related Rent or not).
